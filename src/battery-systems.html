                <p>This is not about “throwing some 18650s into a box”. These packs are designed like small industrial projects: defined voltage levels, targeted current capability, deliberate cell choice, smart BMS integration, and custom software to make everything measurable and controllable.</p>
                <p><strong>Two main systems:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A 12s4p VTC6 pack for a DIY longboard.</li>
                    <li>A 20s4p high-power pack (Reliance RS50 level) paired with an X12 controller and X1 Pro Gen 4 motor for an e-bike targeting up to 8 kW.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On top of that sits a smart BMS layer with custom software logic that turns a pile of cells into a monitored high-performance energy system.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem;">12s4p VTC6 Longboard Pack – Maximum Power in Minimal Space</h2>
                
                <h3>Electrical Specs</h3>
                <p>Space inside the deck was brutally limited, so the pack geometry dictated everything. The result: a 12s4p pack built from Sony/Murata VTC6 cells.</p>

                </picture>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> 12s4p</li>
                    <li><strong>Cell type:</strong> VTC6, ~3.0 Ah, true high-drain cells</li>
                    <li><strong>Voltage:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nominal: 12 × 3.6 V = 43.2 V</li>
                            <li>Fully charged: 12 × 4.2 V = 50.4 V</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Current capability (pack):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>60 A continuous</li>
                            <li>90 A peak</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Power output:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continuous at nominal voltage: 60 A × 43.2 V = 2,592 W ≈ 2.6 kW</li>
                            <li>Peak at nominal voltage: 90 A × 43.2 V = 3,888 W ≈ 3.9 kW</li>
                            <li>At full charge (50.4 V): 60 A → 3.0 kW, 90 A → 4.5 kW</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    <h3>What does 3–4.5 kW under your feet actually mean?</h3>
                    <p>Rough comparisons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Typical rental e-scooter: ~250–500 W</li>
                        <li>Legal EU city e-bike (pedelec): 250 W rated, maybe 500–750 W peak</li>
                        <li>Household kettle: ~2 kW</li>
                        <li>Vacuum cleaner: 1.2–2.0 kW</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The longboard pack is in a different league: more continuous power than a kettle, 8–15× the power of a standard pedelec, and up to ~6 hp peak. The real limit is not the electrics anymore, but traction, road quality, and how much acceleration the rider is willing to tolerate.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Mechanics, Busbars, and Thermals</h3>
                <p>With 12s4p you get high energy density, but also serious currents: 60–90 A through the pack means 15–22.5 A per cell in a 4p group. That’s exactly the range where VTC6 makes sense. To handle that cleanly:</p>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="batterypack/20210213_174858.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="batterypack/20210213_174858.jpg" alt="Finished carbon fiber enclosure for the longboard battery pack, showing a clean and robust mechanical design." loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900">
                </picture>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nickel + copper “sandwich” busbars to keep resistance low and spread heat.</li>
                    <li>Short current paths to minimize voltage drop and hot spots.</li>
                    <li>Spot-welded connections plus mechanically relieved cables so board flex and vibration don’t fatigue joints.</li>
                    <li>Layered pack structure: cells → insulation (fishpaper, cell rings) → busbars → BMS leads → protective enclosure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thermally, you are in a zone where internal resistance and high C-rates produce noticeable heat under hard riding. Spreading current across 4p and using enough copper makes it manageable. In practice you get a compact, very dense pack that hits hard without immediately cooking itself.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem;">20s4p e-Bike Pack – Pushing Toward 8 kW</h2>
                <p>The e-bike project goes a step further. Here, the goal isn’t “fit into a tiny cavity”, it’s power reserve. The idea: an e-bike that behaves much more like a lightweight motorcycle than a city pedelec.</p>
                
                <h3>Configuration and Power Target</h3>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="batterypack/20250604_172442.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="batterypack/20250604_172442.jpg" alt="E-bike battery pack wrapped in green tape during assembly, with cell group numbers marked." loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900">
                </picture>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pack:</strong> 20s4p</li>
                    <li><strong>Cell class:</strong> High-drain cells on the level of Reliance RS50 (serious high-power segment)</li>
                    <li><strong>System voltage:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nominal: 20 × 3.6 V = 72 V</li>
                            <li>Full: 20 × 4.2 V = 84 V</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> X12 controller, X1 Pro Gen 4 motor</li>
                    <li><strong>Target power:</strong> up to 8 kW</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Back-calculating current from 8 kW: at 72 V nominal this is ~111 A, or ~27.8 A per cell in a 4p group. Firmly in high-drain territory.</p>

                <div class="info-box-accent">
                    <h3>How brutal is 8 kW on an e-bike?</h3>
                    <p>Some sanity checks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A legal pedelec is 250 W rated. 8 kW is a 32x increase.</li>
                        <li>Many 125cc motorbikes have ~8–11 kW.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You’re essentially running motorbike-level power in a bicycle-like platform. This means explosive acceleration where uphill segments stop being “obstacles” and become “playgrounds”.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Pack Construction: 20s4p on Motorcycle Level</h3>
                <p>Requirements here are harsher than on the longboard due to higher duty cycles and mechanical abuse. Design choices:</p>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="batterypack/20250605_160959.webp" type="image/webp">
                    <img src="batterypack/20250605_160959.jpg" alt="Fully assembled 20s4p e-bike battery pack with thick power leads and integrated BMS." loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900">
                </picture>
                <ul>
                    <li>Copper-reinforced busbars to keep voltage drop low at >100 A.</li>
                    <li>Clear segmentation: 20 series groups, each a 4p block with its own sense wire to the BMS.</li>
                    <li>Modular pack philosophy so parts can be serviced.</li>
                    <li>Enclosure designed against rocks, water, and dust, while allowing some passive cooling.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The result is a pack that doesn’t just hit 8 kW once, but can be ridden hard without collapsing electrically or mechanically.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem;">Smart BMS – Turning Cells into a System</h2>
                <p>Bare cells only get you raw potential. The smart BMS layer turns that into a controlled, observable system.</p>
                <h3>BMS Capabilities</h3>
                <p>The chosen Smart BMS platform provides per-series-group voltage measurement, multiple temperature sensors, and an integrated shunt for current measurement. It communicates via UART/CAN and Bluetooth and provides protection against over/undervoltage, overcurrent, and short-circuits, along with cell balancing and fault logging.</p>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="batterypack/20250605_130201.webp" type="image/webp">

                </picture>
                
                <h3>Custom Software – From BMS Data to Live Telemetry</h3>
                <p>The interesting part is the custom software wrapped around the BMS. The goal: the pack should behave like a defined energy server, not a black box. A small service (e.g., in Python) polls the BMS, normalizes the data (voltage, current, SoC, temps), and logs it. On top of that, live dashboards and alarm logic can be built for voltage deviation, over-temperature, or current spikes. This allows for software-side limits, like derating power at high temps or low SoC.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem;">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Measurement vs. Reality:</strong> Smart BMS numbers are not always lab-grade. Shunt measurements drift and SoC estimations are often just suggestions. Workarounds involve building custom SoC curves from empirical data and adjusting alarm thresholds to actual behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regenerative Braking and Unexpected Peaks:</strong> Powerful controllers can push very high charge currents back into the pack. Regen must be limited in the controller to prevent the BMS from triggering overcharge protection and causing cutouts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mechanics Beat Theory:</strong> No matter how pretty the schematic, vibration, flex, and impacts are constantly trying to break things. Strain relief, glue points, and smart cable routing matter as much as busbar cross-section. Packs that are mechanically rock solid keep working.</li>
                    <li><strong>Field Debugging Without Telemetry is Painful:</strong> When something fails mid-ride, “it just shut off” is worthless. With Smart BMS logging, you can see which cell group sagged, whether overcurrent or undervoltage tripped, and how hot the pack was. This turns trial-and-error into forensic analysis.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem;">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The longboard and e-bike packs follow the same philosophy at different scales. The key isn’t just raw cell chemistry, but smart design, proper busbar engineering, a capable Smart BMS, and a thin layer of custom software that makes the whole system observable and controllable. The result is a custom high-performance energy system, repeatable, measurable, and tunable far beyond hobby level.</p>
